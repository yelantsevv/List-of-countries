# [List-of-countries](https://yelantsevv.github.io/List-of-countries/)

This project is an interactive country data table built with **React 19**. Users can sort, filter, and view detailed information about each country in a modal popup.

- Performance optimizations using `memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`
- The app uses the new React 19 `use()` hook to fetch data directly in the component without `useEffect` or `useState`
- A detailed modal (Card component) is rendered outside the main DOM tree using `createPortal()`
